## Flexmonster Pivot Table & Charts

Flexmonster Pivot is a powerful JavaScript tool for interactive web reporting. It allows you to visualize and analyze data from JSON, CSV, SQL, NoSQL, Elasticsearch, and OLAP data sources quickly and conveniently. Flexmonster is designed to integrate seamlessly with any client-side framework and can be easily embedded into your application.

This package is a Flexmonster Connector for [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) applications.

[Flexmonster MongoDB Connector](https://www.flexmonster.com/doc/introduction-to-the-flexmonster-mongodb-connector/) is a special server-side tool intended to help you retrieve the data from a MongoDB database to Flexmonster Pivot. It has to be embedded into a server that accepts requests for the data from Flexmonster and passes them to the Connector.
